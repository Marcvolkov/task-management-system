- [ ] Create consistent form styling across all auth forms

### 7. Analytics & Statistics

- [ ] Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation with new design
- [ ] Validate responsive design across devices

## Implementation Guidelines

### Design Principles
- **Consistency**: Use a unified design system across all components
- **Performance**: Ensure animations don't impact application performance
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsiveness**: Design works seamlessly on all device sizes

### Technical Considerations
- Use CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for component styling
- Implement CSS custom properties for theme switching
- Leverage modern CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, CSS animations)
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Quality Assurance
- Test each component individually after redesign
- Verify all existing functionality remains intact
- Cross-browser testing for visual consistency
- Performance testing with new visual effects

## Progress Tracking

Each task will be tracked and validated before moving to the next phase. Regular checkpoints ensure the design improvements don't break existing functionality while delivering a modern, professional user experience.
